### 2018 - Interactive tutorials in machine learning (bachelor thesis) 
Tutorial was created with interactive environment - Jupyter Notebook, in which fundamentals of machine learning were explained using two diﬀerent algorithms. Along with this tutorial, I have implemented interactive web application providing extensive interactive visualizations to allow deeper tracking of Naive Bayesian text classiﬁcation process. Using interactive elements it is able to experiment with diﬀerent algorithm conﬁgurations and observe relationships between data samples and its attributes via graphs. 

Used technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Dash framework, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
